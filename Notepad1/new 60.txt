1st Dec CPQ HLA session
create quotation - then negitiation happens and finnilazied- take final approval with the contract period - quotation approved- then sales order created--sales and customer- they follow the draft contract to legal dept- then legal dept will issue the final contract

from the quotation sales agreement will generated from CPQ

1 PO they wil recive from customer but they will deliver partially . they will recieve more than one po from customer through out the year - need to check how we will achive this in CPQ

price will remain same throug out the year

DO we have any proposal date for delivery in salesagteement : NO as per Mr Shaya

Discount is not fixed for all the item- they will manually adjusted by sales rep

the sales rep need to  differentiate that this is gonna be a sales agreement not the quotation

quote document-sales agreement-sales order

sales agreement can be defined from Fusion itself directly -

contract is diffferent than quotation- contract is kind of 15 page- they create the contract manually- there is no link of contract in the sytem in current process its all total a manual process

Mr Shaya- will highlight the fixed part of contract and send it back to Mr Khurram- that needs to be shared with us

aloing with the quotation document they send the contract as a draft to their customer - then they will get approval from customer after that - sales rep will send the draft contract to legal dept fro signing purpose of both the parties
There is no legal stamp paer for contract- the contract will be just in A4 size paper.

The contract is going to be different from customer to customer.

They maintaine this salesagteement only hard copy- Mr Shaya

We need to discuss with Order Management team

As per Gopal we have collected all the scenario keepeing in mind that we will be able to follow up in CPQ
